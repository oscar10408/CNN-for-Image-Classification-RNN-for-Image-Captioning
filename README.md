# CNN-for-Image-Classification-RNN-for-Image-Captioning
A deep dive into building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) from scratch using NumPy â€” no TensorFlow or PyTorch. Includes CNN for image classification and RNN for image captioning. Also features custom training loop, optimizers, and gradient flows implemented manually for full transparency.
